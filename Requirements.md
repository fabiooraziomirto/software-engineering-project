# Informal description
Medium companies and retailers need a simple application to manage the relationship with suppliers and the inventory of physical items stocked in a physical warehouse. 
The warehouse is supervised by a manager, who supervises the availability of items. When a certain item is in short supply, the manager issues an order to a supplier. In general the same item can be purchased by many suppliers. The warehouse keeps a list of possible suppliers per item. 

After some time the items ordered to a supplier are received. The items must be quality checked and stored in specific positions in the warehouse. The quality check is performed by specific roles (quality office), who apply specific tests for item (different items are tested differently). Possibly the tests are not made at all, or made randomly on some of the items received. If an item does not pass a quality test it may be rejected and sent back to the supplier. 

Storage of items in the warehouse must take into account the availability of physical space in the warehouse. Further the position of items must be traced to guide later recollection of them.

The warehouse is part of a company. Other organizational units (OU) of the company may ask for items in the warehouse. This is implemented via internal orders, received by the warehouse. Upon reception of an internal order the warehouse must collect the requested item(s), prepare them and deliver them to a pick up area. When the item is collected by the other OU the internal order is completed. 

EZWH (EaSy WareHouse) is a software application to support the management of a warehouse.

# Stories and personas
Mario, 30, is the manager of a big company's warehouse, handling hundresds of items per day. He has always managed the position of the goods by himself, leading to some management problems during the years. Also the re-fill process is handled by him, directly calling to different suppliers asking for availabilities of items. He would really like to use an application which can automatize this entire handling process. 

Ercole, 45, has been recently hired as manager in a company that acts as a supplier for other companies or retailers, by selling mechanical components to them. In his previous job, he was used to a software which automatically checks if an order is satisfiable or not and contacts the transportation company. Now he has to manually check the availabilities for every item, and directly phone the transaportation company. He would like to emulate the same experience got in his previous mansion.

Ezio, 35, is the chief of one of the Organizational Unit that composes a worldwide company. Anytime he needs an item from the central warehouse, he send an internal order request to the headquarter offices, which will be only later sent to the warehouse, resulting in a huge delay of time due to burocracy. He would really appreciate a software that manages a direct communication with the warehouse manager.
